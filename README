Welcome to Witty Plus

This is a library built on top of the brilliant Wt library.

It reduces Wt's flexibility by taking away some options.
But it make it easier to get an app off the ground.

Wt+ provides the main app framework and you provide a bunch of pages mapped to urls, some CSS and if you like some templates.

It provides a complete set of auth (pasword, facebook, and google).

Example usage:

#include <WtPlus/urlMapper>
#include <WtPlus/main>

int main(int argc, char** argv) {
    WtPlus::URLMapper urlMapper {
        {"/"}, {[](Wt::WWidget base) { return new MyMainWindow(base); }},

    };
    WtPlus::main(argc, argv, urlMapper);
}
